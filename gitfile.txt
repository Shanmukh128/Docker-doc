Git & Githud both are different 

There are Four types
	-vcs & git repos
	-staging area & commite
	-Braches
	-issues & prs
-vcs stands for version control system	
      -vcs means if you storing application data in git
      - If you deployed a new version and that version have more debugs then you should go for old version and
        that version is stored in git
      -then sampley we can revorte back from the git

   what is repository (repo)
   repository is noting but project folder we can store the data

-1. what is remote repository
   remote repository means it is stored some server we using form here    

-2. what is local repository
   loacl repository means you store data in local system

-3. what is staging area 
    staging area means we can call file from the working directory either single file or multiable files 

-4 what is working directory
    working directory means it like a present working directory we create a files and folders here what we need

EXAMPLE-----
          we created three file in working directory and we called either one or two files to staging area and 
          then staging area to local repository in staging area two files are there two files are copyed to local 
          repository number file are there in staging area that file are copyed to local repository single files
          are not copyed to local repository how many file are there in staging area that all file are copyed to 
          local repository (commit) and finial remote repository all the file avialable in local repository that 
          all file are copyed to remote repository one and two files are not copyed all the files available in 
          loacl repository copyed to remote repository (push)

There four type of branchs-
         -main/master branch
         -futher branch
         -release branch
         -hot fix branch
         --avery code or any thing can be stored in main/master branch then it can be pushed to release branch
         --future branch is you need to add any thing or you need to write a new version that any thing can written
           in the futher branch and it can tested avery thing is fine it pushed to main/master branch. main/master
           is pushed to the release branch then it reches to customer
         -hot fix --if customer facing an issue with thing use need change immedetaly.hot fix means ypu have solve 
          very fast (2-3 days) that is the hot fix
